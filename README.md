# WordPress + Vue

Currently experimenting with creating a WP theme that relies on Vue.
I'm not thinking too hard about SEO at the moment (currently have server-side content in a `<noscript>` tag), this is more of a learning project.

## Setup

1. You'll need to bring your own WordPress installation.
2. Install the [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/) plugin.
2. `cd` into `wp-content/themes/teej` and run `npm install` or `yarn`.
3. Run `npm run watch` to get going.

## Resources

1. [Laravel Mix](https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix)
2. [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
3. [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/)
